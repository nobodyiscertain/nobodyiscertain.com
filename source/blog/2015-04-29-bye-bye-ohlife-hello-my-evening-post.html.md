I loved [OhLife](http://ohlife.com). I really did. If you’re not familiar with
OhLife, it was a web app that sent you a daily email asking how your day went.
You’d reply with whatever you want, maybe throw in a photo or two, and just
like that, you’ve got an entry in your private journal.

Once you had a few posts written, the real magic of the service started to
shine. At the bottom of the reminder emails, they would include a random post
from the archives. It was awesome to see a post from months or even years ago.
It was motivation to write more.

OhLife was a free service. They later launched a premium product for $24/year,
but that was all the money they’d allow me to give them. I bought it to show
support. To put my vote in saying, “Yes, please keep doing what you do.”

### The Breakup

I had four years of posts with OhLife. Four years. I wrote about my grandmother
dying, getting married, having a tooth extracted, my son being born and
everything between. I would of used it forever.

When I got the email that they were closing up shop, I was heartbroken. What
was I going to do? I tried migrating to Evernote & DayOne, but it’s just not
the same. I had to _go to_ those apps to write. They didn’t come to me. And
they didn’t have a random post as motivation. It was just another journal app
and it was getting neglected.

### The Fix

I set out to solve this problem the same way I do for everything, with code. I
started to write an add-on to the back of my personal site that would mimic the
behavior, a hack at best. I told a [friend and fellow OhLife
lover](https://twitter.com/yikes), about my hack one night and after a
conversation over a few beers, we decided to tackle the problem together and
make it better in the process. I’d head up development and he’d tackle design
and marketing. After many more conversations, beers and late nights, My Evening
Post was born.

We’ve created a writing platform that I think you’re going to like and we’re
super excited to share it with you.

### My Evening Post

It has all the things we loved about OhLife and some new additions that make it
better. For example: If you got tired of removing your email signature from
every post, we’ve a got a nifty little feature to ease that pain. We’ve also
got a list of ideas to make this service something special moving forward. Life
moves along pretty fast and we’ve got a dead simple way to capture it.

If you’ve got an OhLife hole in your soul or are just wanting an easy way to
write and journal more, then by all means, [come check us out](https://myeveningpost.com)!
